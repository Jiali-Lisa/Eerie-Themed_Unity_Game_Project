  - Finally the class is over.
  - Why is everything here so different from what i remembered?
  - Now I have some free time to explore the classroom.
  - I need to figure out what happened to that girl.
  - There is a diary on the table on my right. I should have a check.
  - Maybe that belongs to that girl.
